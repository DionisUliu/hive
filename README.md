The aim of Hive is to create an innovative solution that enhances the management of a student housing complex comprising three buildings, each with nine floors, and multiple rooms on each floor. The primary objective is to develop a comprehensive system that optimizes building management, room allocation, and resident information. 
Possible solutions may include centralized software for room assignments, resident profiles, maintenance requests, and communication systems to make life in the student housing more efficient and convenient.

The objective is to leverage coding and system design skills to create an efficient and user-friendly solution for student housing management. The resulting system should simplify the administration process for housing administrators and enhance the overall experience for residents. 

## Features

* Building Visualization: This feature offers a comprehensive view of the entire housing complex, allowing administrators to swiftly assess the status of all buildings, floors, and rooms. It is essential for efficient management, enabling quick identification of vacant rooms, monitoring resident distribution, and ensuring a rapid response to emergencies, thereby enhancing safety and operational efficiency.

* Contract Management: Effective contract management is crucial for financial stability. This feature streamlines the oversight, attachment, and management of contracts for each room. Providing administrators with a clear overview of contract details, including start and end dates, guarantees contract compliance, accurate financial records, and adherence to allocation terms. It's a financial safeguard for the housing complex.

* Resident Profiles: The resident profiles feature creates a valuable repository of occupant information. It empowers administrators to provide personalized support by accessing comprehensive profiles containing personal data, contact information, and specific requirements or notes. This not only fosters individualized care but also enables efficient issue resolution and contributes to the overall safety and well-being of residents.

* Room Status: Real-time room status indicators are indispensable for optimizing room allocation and enhancing the resident experience. These indicators simplify the allocation process by providing instant information on room occupancy. This reduces conflicts, streamlines the allocation of available rooms, and ensures quick responses to resident inquiries and requests, ultimately improving the overall living experience.
